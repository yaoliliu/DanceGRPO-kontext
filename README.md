## DanceGRPO
**DanceGRPO is the first unified RL-based framework for visual generation.**

This is the official implementation for [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07818), DanceGRPO: Unleashing GRPO on Visual Generation.
We develop [DanceGRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07818) based on FastVideo, a scalable and efficient framework for video and image generation.

## Key Features

DanceGRPO has the following features:
- Support Stable Diffusion
- Support FLUX
- Support HunyuanVideo

## Updates

- __[2025.05.12]__: 🔥 We released the paper in arXiv!
- __[2025.05.28]__: 🔥 We released the training scripts of FLUX and Stable Diffusion!
- __[2025.07.03]__: 🔥 We released the training scripts of HunyuanVideo!


## Getting Started
### Downloading checkpoints
You should use ```"mkdir"``` for these folders first. 

For image generation,
1. Download the Stable Diffusion v1.4 checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) to ```"./data/stable-diffusion-v1-4"```.
2. Download the FLUX checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) to ```"./data/flux"```.
3. Download the HPS-v2.1 checkpoint (HPS_v2.1_compressed.pt) from [here](https://huggingface.co/xswu/HPSv2/tree/main) to ```"./hps_ckpt"```.
4. Download the CLIP H-14 checkpoint (open_clip_pytorch_model.bin) from [here](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K/tree/main) to ```"./hps_ckpt"```.

For video generation,
1. Download the HunyuanVideo checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/hunyuanvideo-community/HunyuanVideo) to ```"./data/HunyuanVideo"```.
2. Download the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) to ```"./Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct"```.
3. Download the VideoAlign checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/VideoReward) to ```"./videoalign_ckpt"```.

### Installation
```bash
./env_setup.sh fastvideo
```
### Training
```bash
# for Stable Diffusion, with 8 H800 GPUs
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_sd_grpo.sh   
```
```bash
# for FLUX, preprocessing with 8 H800 GPUs
bash scripts/preprocess/preprocess_flux_rl_embeddings.sh
# for FLUX, training with 16 H800 GPUs for better convergence 
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_flux_grpo.sh   
```

For image generation open-source version, we use the prompts in [HPD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ymhao/HPDv2/tree/main) dataset for training, as shown in ```"./prompts.txt"```.

```bash
# for HunyuanVideo, preprocessing with 8 H800 GPUs
bash scripts/preprocess/preprocess_hunyuan_rl_embeddings.sh
# for HunyuanVideo, training with 16/32 H800 GPUs for better convergence
bash scripts/finetune/finetune_hunyuan_grpo.sh   
```

For the video generation open-source version, we filter the prompts from [VidProM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WenhaoWang/VidProM) dataset for training, as shown in ```"./video_prompts.txt"```.

### Image Generation Rewards
We give the (moving average) reward curves (also the results in **`reward.txt`** or **`hps_reward.txt`**) of Stable Diffusion (left or upper) and FLUX (right or lower). We can complete the FLUX training (200 iterations) within **12 hours** with 16 H800 GPUs.

1. We provide more visualization examples (base, 80 iters rlhf, 160 iters rlhf) in ```"./assets/flux_visualization"```. We always use larger resolutions and more sampling steps than RLHF training for visualization, because we use lower resolutions and less sampling steps for speeding up the RLHF training.
2. Here is the visualization script `"./scripts/visualization/vis_flux.py"` for FLUX. First, run `rm -rf ./data/flux/transformer/*` to clear the directory, then copy the files from a trained checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoint-160-0`) into `./data/flux/transformer`. After that, you can run the visualization. If it's trained for 160 iterations, the results are already provided in my repo.  
3. More discussion on FLUX can be found in ```"./fastvideo/README.md"```.
4. (Thanks for a community contribution from [@Jinfa Huang](https://infaaa.github.io/), if you change the train_batch_size and train_sp_batch_size from 1 to 2, change the gradient_accumulation_steps from 4 to 12, **you can train the FLUX with 8 H800 GPUs**, and you can finish the FLUX training within a day.)


### Video Generation Rewards
We give the (moving average) reward curves (also the results in **`vq_reward.txt`**) of HunyuanVideo with 16/32 H800 GPUs.

With 16 H800 GPUs,

With 32 H800 GPUs,

1. For the open-source version, our mission is to reduce the training cost. So we reduce the number of frames, sampling steps, and GPUs compared with the settings in the paper. So the reward curves will be different, but the VQ improvements are similar (50%~60%). 
2. For visualization, run `rm -rf ./data/HunyuanVideo/transformer/*` to clear the directory, then copy the files from a trained checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoint-100-0`) into `./data/HunyuanVideo/transformer`. After that, you can run the visualization script `"./scripts/visualization/vis_hunyuanvideo.sh"`.
3. Although training with 16 H800 GPUs has similar rewards with 32 H800 GPUs, I still find that 32 H800 GPUs leads to better visulization results.
4. We plot the rewards by **de-normalizing**, with the formula VQ = VQ * 2.2476 + 3.6757 by following [here](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/VideoReward/blob/main/model_config.json).


### Multi-reward Training
