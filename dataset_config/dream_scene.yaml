datasets:  # flux is the type of dataset for kontext. It is a folder of images with captions.
  # datasets are a folder of images. captions need to be txt files with the same name as the image
  # for instance image2.jpg and image2.txt. Only jpg, jpeg, and png are supported currently
  # images will automatically be resized and bucketed into the resolution specified
  # on windows, escape back slashes with another backslash so
  # "C:\\path\\to\\images\\folder"

    # control path is the input images for kontext for a paired dataset. These are the source images you want to change.  
    # You can comment this out and only use normal images if you don't have a paired dataset. 
    # Control images need to match the filenames on the folder path but in
    # a different folder. These do not need captions.
